Exercise 3 Notes
================

*Output files are written to the output directory and have a _comp extension.
For instance output.json is replicated as output_comp.csv in the output directory

*Testing.  Testing for this is also included in the driver file.
The output file isn't comparable to the example output for a few reasons.
1)  The output file wasn't real generated data.  It appeated to be real data for one report that was simply replicated for all reports to give an example file.
2)  json format isn't guaranteed to be sorted.

So testing was done to ensure that the correct fields and field types
were found in the computed json file, but not that the correct values were
present as these values were tested in the previous 2 examples.
